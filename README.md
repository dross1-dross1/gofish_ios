# Go Fish card game made for iOS in Swift using Xcode

New very cool card game app with lots of features. Using this app, you can play
the card game, “Go Fish” at an easy, normal or hard opponent difficulty. The app
also comes with an “auto ask” feature that allows the app to play for you, which
can compete with the highest difficulty level. At the bottom, there is an action log
that lets you keep track of what happened during the opponent’s turn. Input
numbers 2 through 11(Jack) through 14(Ace) to select a rank to ask the opponent.
